Seven Fundamentals Principles of Interaction

1. Discoverability
	- Ability to look at interface and determine what actions are possible and how to perform them.
2. Affordances
	- Relationship between properties of artifact and capabilities of agent that determine how artifact could be used.
3. Signifiers
	- Communication mechanism that inform the user of the appropraite behaviour.
	- Sometimes percieved affordances same as signifiers.
4. Mapping
	- Relationship between controls and corresponding actions.
	- Spatial correspondence is helpful.
	- Some may emerge from cultural practices.
5. Feedback	
	- Shows full and continous information about the results of action and current state of technology.
	- Indicators should be used to show current state.
6. Conceptual Models
	- Simple explanations(typically simple) we form in our head about how a technology works.
	- Some form of documentation is needed to prevent misconceptions.
7. Constraints
	- Constraints set limitations for how people interact with the technology.
	- Four types:
		1. Physical: dimensions of object limit/determine interaction
		2. Cultural: English cultures read left to right while Arabic cultures are reversed
		3. Semantic: Learned meanings
		4. Logical: Things we can do using our logic
